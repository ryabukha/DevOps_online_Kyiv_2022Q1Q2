###### The result is a private repository with multiple branches. And one resolved merge conflict.

I used commands like this:

create a branch in git and switch to it:

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

switch to another branch

```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

add file:
```
git add <file-name>
```

merge branches:

```
git merge <branchname>
```

check status:
```
git status
```

commit:
```
git commit -m "some message"
```
